Dictionaries are sometimes found in other languages as “associative memories” or “associative arrays”. Unlike sequences, which are indexed by a range of numbers, dictionaries are indexed by keys, which can be any immutable type; strings and numbers can always be keys. Tuples can be used as keys if they contain only strings, numbers, or tuples; if a tuple contains any mutable object either directly or indirectly, it cannot be used as a key. You can’t use lists as keys, since lists can be modified in place using index assignments, slice assignments, or methods like append() and extend().\n","\n","## Constructing a Dictionary in Python\n","Dictionary may be constructed in several ways:\n","\n","\n","*   Using a pair of curly braces to denote the empty dictionary: `{}`\n","*   Using curly braces, separating key:value pair with commas: `{'OH': 'Ohio', 'MI': 'Michigan'}`\n","*   Using a dict comprehension: `{x: x** 2 for x in range(10)}`\n","*   Using the type constructor: `dict()` \n","\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"JOZoPM6yn29z"},"outputs":[],"source":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ctTNuEIgsQhJ"},"source":["## Key  / value pairs\n","\n","It is best to think of a dictionary as a set of key: value pairs, with the requirement that the keys are unique (within one dictionary). A pair of braces creates an empty dictionary: `{}`. Placing a comma-separated list of key:value pairs within the braces adds initial key:value pairs to the dictionary; this is also the way dictionaries are written on output.\n","\n","The main operations on a dictionary are storing a value with some key and extracting the value given the key. It is also possible to delete a key:value pair with del. If you store using a key that is already in use, the old value associated with that key is forgotten. It is an error to extract a value using a non-existent key.\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"o0GRnPhMuFRh"},"outputs":[],"source":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"SgoKMIFpuFu0"},"source":["## Operations on Dictionaries\n","\n","These are the operations that dictionaries support (and therefore, custom mapping types should support too):\n","\n","Operaiton | Result\n","-|-\n","`list(d)`|Return a list of all the keys used in the dictionary `d`.\n","`len(d)`|Return the number of items in the dictionary `d`.\n","`d[key]`|Return the item of `d` with `key` key.
